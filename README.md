# StoryBook_AR
A Unity project in which I am building a toolkit to utilize to create interactive AR books. 

Unity project StoryBook AR was made under the I-CORPS Grant. The package was created with the intent of it being a toolkit aiding in the development of AR applications. 
The toolkit includes basic shaders, particle effects, and fonts. It also includes editors for easy use of attaching/removing shaders from game objects and adding/removing text animations to font objects.
